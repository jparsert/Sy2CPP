# Syntax Guided Synthesis library for C++

This is a library for the SyGuS format. Mostly for parsing and getting an AST as well as a symbol table.
I hope to be able to extend this library further to also include interfaces to solvers etc.
Some of the features of this library include:
* Supporting Indexed Identifiers
* No boost library
* C++20



### Currently Supported Theories
* LIA (tested on LIA/LIA_INV of private REPO)

### Requrirements
* c++ supporting standard 2020
* antlr4 runtime
* ...

### TODO
* TESTING!!!
* Parametric sorts
* More Theories
